# Atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS

This project focuses on atmospheric retrievals for a variety of Sub-Neptune exoplanets. Atmospheric retrievals are a powerful method for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres by inferring their physical properties, chemical abundances, and other characteristics from an observed spectrum.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks I have developed to evaluate different temperature-pressure profiles, chemical abundance models, and cloud/haze properties in the atmospheres of the analyzed planets. Additionally, the repository includes the spectrum data used in the retrievals and some models for the temperature-pressure profile, not included in the built-in models of _petit_, that I have developed and used in the retrievals.

The content of this repository is part of my undergraduate thesis and it is a work in progress. I aim to update it regularly as I continue refining the models and exploring new approaches.
