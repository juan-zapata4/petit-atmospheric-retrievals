# Atmospheric Retrievals of K2-18b using petitRADTRANS

## Abstract

K2-18b is a temperate habitable-zone Sub-Neptune that has attracted significant interest due to its potential to host a $\ce{H/He}$-rich envelope and to contain $\ce{H2O}$ traces in its atmosphere. Transmission spectroscopy with JWST has revealed the presence of the carbon-bearing molecules $\ce{CH4}$ and $\ce{CO2}$ along with the non-detection of $\ce{NH3}$, aligning with the "Hycean" world scenario, which consists of a shallow $\ce{H2}$-dominated atmosphere overlaying a potentially liquid water surface ocean, creating optimal conditions that favour habitability. Recent studies have proposed alternative scenarios compatible with observations, including a mini-Neptune scenario with a deep atmosphere and no well-defined surface, or a lava world scenario consisting of a molten magma ocean on its surface. Here, we report a Bayesian retrieval analysis of K2-18b's transmission spectrum, exploring several models for its chemical composition, temperature profile, and cloud properties. We evaluate a set of not self-consistent atmospheric retrievals aiming to constrain the atmospheric properties, examining the detection significance of key molecular species and investigating how grey and non-grey cloud treatments impact the inferred structure and composition. For both cloud treatments, we find detection significances for $\ce{CH4}$ and $\ce{CO2}$ of $5\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, while finding no significant evidence for $\ce{H2O}$ and $\ce{NH3}$, in agreement with previous studies. Additionally, we find that a cloud-free atmosphere for K2-18b is strongly ruled out by observations. Our results suggest that a model consisting of non-grey cloud treatment and following a semi-ideal temperature-pressure profile provides the best fit to the observed spectrum.
